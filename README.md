# Hackintosh for Lenovo G580

READ ME!
Hello there!
Welcome to my Hackintosh place. I do not know how you did find this place, but hi.
These are really important files for the laptop Lenovo G580 if you want to install a Hackintosh.
You can find drivers and a Clover setup which works on that laptop.
Have fun!

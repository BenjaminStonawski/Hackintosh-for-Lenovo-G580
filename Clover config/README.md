# Lenovo G580 Clover files

THE FILES THAT YOU NEED TO COPY TO /EFI/CLOVER ARE IN THE ZIP FILE!


Things that I could make working with that:
- iMessage and FaceTime
- HD Graphics 3000 with: Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina
- iCloud and iCloud Drive
- AirDrop if you have a compatible WiFi card
- Siri


Things that I couldn’t make working with that:
- Sleep
- Siri on Mojave


This Clover works with: Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina


Serial Number and iMessage: I’m using a valid-ish serial number which is not used by any Mac computer, 
[valid without a purchase date] In the config.plist file, there is just a generated serial number, 
I have no idea if it will have working iMessage instantly. I recommend GenSMBIOS to get a working 
iMessage serial number for your Hack. Have fun! ˆ.ˆ

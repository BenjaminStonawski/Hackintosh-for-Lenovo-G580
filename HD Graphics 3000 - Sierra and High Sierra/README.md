#HD Graphics 3000 Drivers for Sierra & High Sierra
Hello there!
Looks like you need a driver for your HD3000 for Sierra and High Sierra.
Do not worry! You don’t need it :D
The MacBook Pro 13” Early 2011 already has a HD3000 iGPU so you don’t need to do anything, it will work without any trickery!
Have fun!
